# Astro Run
This is my first attempt at developing something completely independent of a learning curriculum or course.


In this game, the player pilots a spaceship through a 2D field of asteroids to deliver cargo. The reward for each mission is a payout based on delivery efficiency.

### The game will allow you to plan before you fly:
- **You decide** how much fuel to carry!
	- Agility decreases as fuel load increases
	- Fuel may be more expensive in certain ports
- You can purchase upgrades to the ship's engines, weapons, defenses, and the cargo hold

### Your job is to avoid damaging the ship or cargo
 - Some cargo will be damage-tolerant, others will be fragile
 - Ship damage will incur penalties and costs to repair
 - Damaging your ship beyond a certain point will require an expensive rescue
